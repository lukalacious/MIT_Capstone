Capstone Project
Music Recommendation System
Context:
With the advent of technology, societies have become more eﬃcient with their lives. At the same
time, however, individual human lives have also become more fast-paced and distracted, leaving
little time to explore artistic pursuits. Also, technology has made significant advancements in the
ability to coexist with art and general entertainment. It has in fact made it easier for humans with a
shortage of time to find and consume good content.
Almost every internet-based company's revenue relies on the time consumers spend on its platform.
These companies need to be able to figure out what kind of content is needed in order to increase
customer time spent and make their experience better. Therefore, one of the key challenges for
these companies is figuring out what kind of content their customers are most likely to consume.

Spotify is one such audio content provider with a huge market base across the world. With the
ever-increasing volume of songs becoming available on the Internet, searching for songs of interest
has become a tedious task in itself. However, Spotify has grown significantly in the market because
of its ability to recommend the ‘best’ next song to each and every customer based on a huge
preference database gathered over time - millions of customers and billions of songs. This is done
by using smart recommendation systems that can recommend songs based on users’ likes/dislikes.
Objective
Build a recommendation system to propose the top 10 songs for a user based on the likelihood of
listening to those songs.
