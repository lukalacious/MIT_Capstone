Dear @channel,

I hope you are doing well.

Following are the key differences between the Milestone, Capstone and Live Presentation:

Milestone Submission: (Deadline 9th June)

Focus:

Initial Exploration: This stage is about initial data exploration and understanding patterns within the data.
Initial Insights: Extracting early insights from univariate, bivariate analyses, or unsupervised learning methods like clustering.
Modeling Techniques: Test various modeling techniques and assess their performances.
Implementation Feasibility: Evaluating potential challenges, benefits, and outcomes of different solutions.

Submission Should Include:

Exploration of data using techniques learned so far.
Key insights from the data relevant to solving the problem.
Results from initial predictive models and their performance comparisons.
Well-informed perspective on effective final modeling techniques.


Final Submission: (16th June)

Focus:

Key Takeaways: Summarizing findings from the Milestone phase.
Refined Model: Presenting and justifying the final proposed model.
Implementation Recommendations: Providing actionable insights, expected benefits, and addressing potential challenges.

Submission Should Include:

Executive Summary: Highlight the most significant findings and the final model specifications.
Problem and Solution Summary: Recap the problem, explain the reasoning behind the proposed solution, and discuss its business impact.
Implementation Recommendations: Key actionable items for stakeholders, benefits and costs analysis, risks or challenges, and further analysis required.

Live Presentation Slide Deck: (Deadline : 16th June)

Live Presentation (On either 21st/22nd June)

Each learner will be allocated a 15-minute slot for their live presentation with an evaluator. The session will be a one-on-one session scheduled on Zoom and the session structure is as follows:

Initial 8-9 Minutes: The learner will present their slides.
Next 5 Minutes: Q&A session with the evaluator.
Final Minute: Feedback sharing.
